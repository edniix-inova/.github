# 🛰️ FOrECaSt – Fleet Oriented Enhancements for Controls and Strategies

**FOrECaSt** is a service-oriented software framework designed to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of robust control strategies in connected vehicles. It enables modular, hardware-agnostic software development through a data-driven architecture that aligns with European data protection regulations and emerging mobility demands.

### 🌍 Motivation

The vehicle of the future will be a node in the Internet of Things. This evolution introduces not only technical opportunities but also regional challenges—including regulatory constraints like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and post Euro-6 emission standards. FOrECaSt responds to these needs by enabling cooperative, open, and flexible development of connected control strategies across vehicles, edge infrastructure, and personal devices.

## 🔧 Key Principles

### 1. **Modular and Service-Oriented Architecture**
Control features in FOrECaSt are implemented as modular software services, allowing interoperability and platform-agnostic deployment—from vehicle ECUs to edge nodes and personal devices.

### 2. **Data-Centric Functional Design**
FOrECaSt is built around a uniform data interface that governs how services exchange information. This design ensures functional robustness, testability, and ease of deployment across various system configurations.

### 3. **Openness and Standards Alignment**
FOrECaSt draws inspiration from open standards such as SAE J3049 and encourages contributions from the open-source community. Its modular, data-oriented foundation is well suited for both proprietary and collaborative innovation.

## 🧠 About the Functional Architecture

FOrECaSt is not a fixed solution—it is a **data-oriented framework** that supports multiple functional architectures tailored to different application domains. The **automotive-focused architecture** presented below serves as a reference implementation designed around **in-service emissions compliance** and connected vehicle use cases.

> The architecture emphasizes modularity, statistical validation, and knowledge generation through traffic simulation, data processing, and profiling. It represents just **one possible implementation** of the FOrECaSt framework and can be adapted for other domains such as logistics, smart cities, or predictive maintenance.
